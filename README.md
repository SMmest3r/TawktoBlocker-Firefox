# TawktoBlocker-Firefox
Tired of browsing websites in peace, but more and more websites are using the Tawk.to support chat widget? There's nothing wrong with it, but I'm particularly annoyed that it crawls into my face and even sends a notification sound. Plus there are a lot of sites using it where I never need it. That's why I made this extension for browsers so this way all tawk.to scripts, iframes, etc are blocked.
You can install the extension to firefox from here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tawk-to-blocker/
